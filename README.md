## 1. Project Abstract
This project explores the design of an autonomous line-following robot using **pure combinational logic** (74xx series gates) and **PWM signal mixing**, eliminating the need for microcontrollers. It features a novel **Inverted-V sensor geometry** to optimize look-ahead reaction time for high-speed tracking.

## 2. Research Goals
* **Hypothesis:** An "Inverted-V" sensor array ($L, R$ forward, $C$ back) will reduce tracking error at sharp corners compared to a linear array.
* **Method:** Implementation of a "Soft Turn" differential drive using analog PWM injection into a digital logic stream.

## 3. Engineering Log
* [View Development Log](dev_log.md) - *Daily updates, simulation results, and failure analysis.*
